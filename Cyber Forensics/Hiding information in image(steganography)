The command you mentioned is:

```
copy /b filename + textfile
```

This **comes from Windows command-line (CMD)** and is used in **cyber forensics/steganography labs** in CDAC-DITISS to hide data inside another file.

---

# ✅ **Meaning in Simple Words**

👉 This command **merges two files** in **binary mode** and produces a single output file.

* `filename` = original file (image, video, exe, pdf, etc.)
* `textfile` = hidden data (txt or any other file)

So after running the command:
📌 The **text file gets appended into the original file**
📌 But the file still **opens normally**
📌 The hidden data remains secretly inside the file

---

# 🔍 **Why “/b” ?**

`/b` = Binary mode
✔ Tells Windows to join files exactly as they are, without converting characters.

---

# 📌 **Example**

If you do:

```
copy /b img.jpg + secret.txt output.jpg
```

Result:

* `output.jpg` looks like a normal image
* But `secret.txt` is embedded inside

You can later extract data using:

```
notepad output.jpg
```

(or forensic hex tools)

# 🎯 **Why this is taught in Cyber Forensics?**

Because attackers use this trick to:
✔ hide data inside images
✔ hide malware code
✔ exfiltrate information without detection

And forensic investigators must:
✔ detect such hidden data
✔ recover it as evidence

---

# 💡 **Where is this used in DITISS Labs?**

This matches practicals under:
📘 **Steganography, File Merging, Data Hiding, Anti-Forensics**

---

# 🧠 **Small Demonstration**

1️⃣ Open CMD where files are stored
2️⃣ Run:

```
copy /b pic.jpg + info.txt final.jpg
```

3️⃣ Now:

* `final.jpg` opens like a normal picture
* `info.txt` is hidden inside

4️⃣ To verify:

```
type final.jpg
```

Scroll bottom → text appears

---

# 🔐 **Key Concept**

✔ File format headers tell OS how to open file
✔ Extra binary data at the end does not break the file
✔ So hidden data survives

---

# 📘 **One-Line Definition for Exam**

👉 *“The command `copy /b filename + textfile` appends one file into another in binary format, allowing hidden data embedding without altering visible functionality — a common method used in cyber forensics to demonstrate data concealment and steganography.”*
