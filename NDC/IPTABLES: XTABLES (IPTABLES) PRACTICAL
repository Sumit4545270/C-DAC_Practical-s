But **don’t worry bhai**, I’ll still help you properly 😊
Right now I **cannot generate/download a PDF file** due to tool limits, but below is a **complete, exam-ready “solution file content”** for **XTABLES (IPTABLES) practical**.

👉 You can **directly copy–paste this into Word / LibreOffice / Google Docs** and **save as PDF**.
This is **CDAC / lab / viva friendly**, step-by-step, super basic.

# 🔐 XTABLES (IPTABLES) PRACTICAL

## Debian 12 & Windows – Step by Step

---

## 🎯 AIM

To configure basic firewall rules using **xtables (iptables)** on **Debian 12** and test the rules from a **Windows machine**.

---

## 🖥️ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

* **Machine 1:** Debian 12 (Firewall Server)
* **Machine 2:** Windows (Client / Attacker)
* Network connectivity between both machines

---

## 🔹 STEP 1: Check iptables availability (Debian)

```bash
sudo iptables --version
```

✅ Confirms xtables/iptables is installed.

---

## 🔹 STEP 2: Check current firewall rules

```bash
sudo iptables -L -n -v
```

👉 Displays existing rules (if any).

---

## 🔹 STEP 3: Flush existing rules (Clean start)

```bash
sudo iptables -F
```

👉 Removes all existing rules.

---

## 🔹 STEP 4: Allow loopback traffic

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
```

👉 Allows internal system communication.

---

## 🔹 STEP 5: Allow SSH access (IMPORTANT)

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

👉 Prevents SSH lockout.

---

## 🔹 STEP 6: Block ICMP (Ping)

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
```

👉 Blocks ping requests.

---

## 🔹 STEP 7: Set default INPUT policy to DROP

```bash
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
```

👉 Drops all traffic except allowed rules.

---

## 🔹 STEP 8: Testing from Windows

### On Windows Command Prompt:

```cmd
ping <Debian_IP>
```

✅ Expected Result:

```
Request timed out
```

👉 Ping is blocked successfully.

---

## 🔹 STEP 9: Verify rules on Debian

```bash
sudo iptables -L -n
```

👉 Confirms rules are active.

---

## 🔹 STEP 10 (Optional): Allow ICMP again

```bash
sudo iptables -D INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
```

👉 Restores ping access.

---

## ✅ RESULT

Firewall rules using **xtables (iptables)** were successfully configured on **Debian 12** and verified from a **Windows machine**.

---

## 🧠 VIVA / EXAM POINTS

* xtables is the framework used by iptables
* iptables works on **netfilter**
* Default chains: INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD
* Rules are processed **top to bottom**

---

## 📌 CONCLUSION

This practical demonstrates basic firewall implementation using xtables (iptables) to control network traffic effectively.
