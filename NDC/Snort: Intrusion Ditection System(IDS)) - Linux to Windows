## ✅ What I *can* do immediately for you (no tool needed)

Below is the **FULL SNORT IDS BASIC PRACTICAL** in **super-basic, spoon-feeding 🥄 style**, exactly the **same content** that will go into the PDF.
When you say **“generate PDF now”**, I will convert **this exact content** into **one clean PDF file**.

# 🛡️ SNORT INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM

## BASIC PRACTICAL (Debian 12 + Windows)

---

## 🎯 AIM

To install and configure **Snort IDS** and detect a **PING (ICMP) attack**.

---

## 🖥️ MACHINES USED

1. **Debian 12** – Snort Server
2. **Windows** – Attacker (Ping)

---

## 🔹 STEP 1: Update Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
```

---

## 🔹 STEP 2: Install Snort

```bash
sudo apt install snort -y
```

👉 During install, when it asks:

```
Network interface:
```

Type:

```
eth0
```

(or `ens33` → check with `ip a`)

---

## 🔹 STEP 3: Check Snort Version

```bash
snort -V
```

✔️ Output means Snort installed successfully

---

## 🔹 STEP 4: Edit Snort Configuration

```bash
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

Find:

```conf
ipvar HOME_NET any
```

Replace with:

```conf
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
```

Save → `CTRL+O` → Enter → `CTRL+X`

---

## 🔹 STEP 5: Create Snort Rule (PING Detect)

```bash
sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
```

Paste:

```conf
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP PING DETECTED"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

Save & Exit

---

## 🔹 STEP 6: Test Snort Configuration

```bash
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

✔️ Expected:

```
Snort successfully validated the configuration!
```

---

## 🔹 STEP 7: Run Snort (IDS Mode)

```bash
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```

➡️ Snort is now listening

---

## 🔹 STEP 8: Attack from Windows

On **Windows CMD**:

```cmd
ping <Debian_IP>
```

Example:

```cmd
ping 192.168.1.10
```

---

## 🔹 STEP 9: Alert Output

On Debian terminal:

```
[**] ICMP PING DETECTED [**]
```

🎉 **Attack detected successfully**

---

## 📌 CONCLUSION

Snort IDS successfully detected ICMP traffic using rule-based intrusion detection.

---

## 🧠 EXAM / VIVA LINE

> Snort is an open-source Intrusion Detection System used to monitor network traffic and generate alerts based on predefined rules.
